### HOW TO UPDATE? ###
######################

1) If updating from previous versions, first completely remove 📁mod_hoodsSwitchableCloak folder from your 📁Mods folder

   * Please avoid using the overwrite method — when I say to remove a folder, I mean you should delete it entirely.

2) Then, unpack new 📁mod_hoodsSwitchableCloak folder into your 📁Mods folder

3) Make sure to update mod menu.
   Copy 📁mod_hoodsSwitchableCloak/bin folder to your game root directory.
   And then use Menu Filelist Updater (link below) or manually add new .xml to your dx11/dx12 txt list.

4) [IMPORTANT] Use a Script Merger or Script Merger FAE (links below), just to be sure there are no conflicts with other mods

5) Run the game and be sure to double check mod menu options (make them default, if required)
   * Sometime they can be turned off after update, so this is important step.

6) That's it.
